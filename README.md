## Main functionalities
Homepage displays lists of components, and a big input bar. Selecting the location, picking a date, and other parameters necessary for booking.

Hotels page is what comes after hitting the search button. Currently it is static as the api hasn't been implemented yet. The page will serve results from the search and will allow adjusting the parameters.

Single Hotel page displays all data from one property.

In the main directory, you can run
### `npm start`
This runs the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000/


## In Future updates
Implementing API to fetch live data and remove static components.
Implement sufficient backend to perform searches and filtering of properties.
